# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to explore how different types of CRM marketing campaigns perform across various customer segments.
Using Power BI as the main tool, this project aims to visualize campaign effectiveness, understand customer responses, and identify patterns that may help improve future marketing strategies.

In addition, Python was used for basic statistical testing to support data-driven insights. The project was developed using synthetic data for the purpose of learning and practice.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic marketing campaign dataset, designed to simulate real-world CRM data. It includes key attributes related to campaign types, communication channels, target audiences, customer segments, and campaign outcomes such as conversion rate, ROI, and engagement score.

The data was stored in a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS, and later imported into Power BI for analysis and visualization. Basic data preprocessing and validation were performed to ensure consistency before building the dashboard.
